      <h1>Modal window!</h1>
      <p>
        A window that suddenly appears (pops up) when you select an option with
        a mouse or press a special function key. Usually, the pop-up window
        contains a menu of commands and stays on the screen only until you
        select one of the commands. It then disappears.</br></br>A special kind of pop-up
        window is a pull-down menu, which appears just below the item you
        selected, as if you had pulled it down. </br></br>Also see pop-up ad.
