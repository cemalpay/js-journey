# Journey into JavaScript: Emphasizing React and Next.js


#### From Zero to Hero


###### A Gentle Reminder

> In this repository, my primary objective is to enhance my JavaScript skills, with a specific focus on React and Next.js. While working on this repo, I have primarily dedicated my efforts to theoretical understanding and practical application of these technologies. Please note that aesthetic considerations were not my primary concern during the coding process. Instead, I aimed to explore and experiment with various compelling and useful elements of Javascript, React and Next.js.
